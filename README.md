# Stress Test

This task took me about 2 hours to complete

## Instructions
Run `npm i && npm start` to run the project

The project is hosted using serve as in didn't seem to need a backend.

## Requirements
Due to the time restrictions the project doesn't include any browser packaging / transpiling tools. The use of ESM means you will need to use a recent browser that supports them.

## External Libraries
### Dev tools
- Serve
- Prettier 
- ESLint
- eslint-plugin-prettier (just to make the latter two work together)
### JS
- Highcharts

## Important notes
- I did not use a front end framework because I just fancied using native JS
- The use of flexbox helps make this look better on different screen sizes but it is far from responsive. 
- I used an external program called CodeKit to compile the SASS so I have included the compiled CSS in the git repo to make your lives easier. Usually I like to transpile the sass as part of the CI build phase.
